# spring-boot-graphql-app


The "spring-boot-graphql-app" is a Spring Boot application that integrates GraphQL, a query language for APIs, with Spring Boot's web framework. It allows clients to query and manipulate data using a single endpoint and a flexible schema. This project showcases how to define GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions, as well as how to map them to Java methods for data fetching and manipulation, providing a modern and efficient approach to building APIs with Spring Boot and GraphQL.
